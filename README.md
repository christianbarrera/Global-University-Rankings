# Global University Rankings
Using data from the Shanghai University World Rankings, I have created a color-coded map to show the number of top 500 universities in each country.  Code available in Jupyter Notebook.  

To see the final map, please follow this link: https://chart-studio.plot.ly/~keedanbarrera/13#plot.  Github does not support plotly style map displays.  

Data from http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2019.html.
