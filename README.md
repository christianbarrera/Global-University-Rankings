# Global University Rankings
Using data from the Shanghai University World Rankings, I have created a map showing the number of top universities in each country with python and Plotly.  Code available here in Jupyter Notebook.  

To see the final map, please follow this link: https://chart-studio.plot.ly/~keedanbarrera/13#plot.  Github does not support plotly style map displays.
